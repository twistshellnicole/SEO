    "## Why Search? (skip if you do SEO)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You typically search alone:** Whether on your phone or laptop,  you are mostly by yourself. This means two things. \n",
    "    - Alone means only for you: If two or more people were to decide on a movie to watch, or a restaurant to go to, they would have to find an option that caters for most people, something like the average. You end up compromising a little. Not with search, you say exactly what you want.\n",
    "    - Alone means private: If a group of friends are talking about something new to you, you might be embarassed to ask what that thing is. Not with Google, you simply search for \"who is X?\" or \"what is Y?\". No embarrasment. Sometimes you might be concerned about something, maybe a medical or psychological condition you might be having. Before alarming your loved ones, you safely go and ask The Google. \n",
    "2. **Search is active:** Compared to most other media, search is one of the few that only happen when you make a request. Listening to the radio, for example, you get messages that you didn't ask for during a show that you asked for.\n",
    "3. **Perfect timing:** Because search is an active task, it happens at the perfect moment. Because you search when you are interested, ready, and receptive.  \n",
    "4. **Expression of interest (not a selection from options):** When you go to a restaurant and are given a menu, you have to choose an option. There might not be exactly what you are craving at that moment, or what your body needs. Again, you will have to compromise a little and order something quite close. With search you say exactly what you want, no matter how ridiculously detailed that thing is that you are searching for. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, on search we express our exact desires, actively, in private, honestly, and when we are most receptive. So, I think it's important to know what content people are given at those moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will connect to Google's custom search engine API: This is mainly used to create a search engine on your website, and allows you to customize it. We will use it to get results for research purposes:\n",
    "1. [Create a custom search engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/).  At first you might be asked to enter a site to search. Enter any domain, then go to the control panel and remove it. Make sure you enable \"Search the entire web\" and image search. You will also need to get your search engine ID, which you can find on the control panel page.  \n",
    "2. [Enable the custom search API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/customsearch.googleapis.com). You wil need to create a project for this first.\n",
    "3. [create credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/customsearch.googleapis.com/credentials) for this project so you can get your key.\n",
    "4. [enable billing for your project](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/projects) If you want to run more than 100 queries per day. The first 100 queries are free, then for each 1,000 queries you pay $5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is set up (once you have your custom search engine ID, and your key), we will be ready to construct our queries and get the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the `serp_goog` function from the [advertools](https://github.com/eliasdabbas/advertools) package. To install it:  \n",
    "`pip install advertools`\n",
    "\n",
