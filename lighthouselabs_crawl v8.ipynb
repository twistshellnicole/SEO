Partnering with Lighthouse Labs to combine the already impressive cognitive skills of people with autism with hands-on learning reflecting a workplace environment, will enable us to further deliver on the promise of the autism advantage for business.” auticon Canada \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ABOUT US \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t OUR SERVICES \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t CONTACT US \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t PRIVACY POLICY \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t |  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t CODE OF CONDUCT \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Facebook-f Twitter Google-plus Linkedin   Sign up to receive future email communications from Lighthouse Labs.

\\n             Lighthouse Labs will take you from coding hobbyist to professional developer, and be the launchpad for your career.   \\n\\n Based out of Canada’s most dynamic tech hubs, you’ll be immersed into full-stack web through hands-on experience. With the support of a brilliant team of instructors and mentors who view coding as the ultimate craft, you’ll join the ranks of over 500 developers in the  Lighthouse Labs community .   \\n\\n Our industry driven curriculum and rigorous education standards have created the ultimate result for our graduates: over  95% employment rate . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How do coding bootcamps compare to traditional education, like a Computer Science degree? \\n             The bootcamp educational model is built very differently from the ones you experienced in high school and/or university. Lighthouse Labs practices a flipped, immersive model of education that puts the emphasis on the development of practical skills through building real-world applications using an incremental and cumulative collection of tools and best practices.   \\n\\n Lectures take up a maximum of two and a half hours in any given day, with another eight to ten hours being spent each day working in a lab setting. You can expect to introduce yourself to new concepts through readings and exercises, getting your knowledge bolstered and backfilled with lectures throughout the week. You can learn more about the bootcamp experience our blog post:  So You Want To Take A Bootcamp    \\n\\n It is our core belief that 80% of the learning should be done on the job and we’ve tailored every part of our program around it. Our curriculum is constantly interrupted by a community of passionate developers based off feedback from employers, students, alumni and industry trends. We won’t teach you everything about software development (that takes years of practice), but we will give you the foundation so you can continue learning in your new career as a developer as quickly as possible.   \\n\\n For more details, read about our  Education Philosophies  or explore our  Student Outcomes Report . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Is Lighthouse Labs an accredited institution? \\n             Lighthouse Labs is accredited by British Columbia  PTIB #03874 , Alberta  PCC #304840  and Ontario  PCC #272306 , and certified by Canada department of  ESDC #7009  and with Revenue QC #20-09-4126,  EQA (Education Quality Assurance) , and with  Educanada . You're here to learn, let us worry about the paperwork. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Do I get a diploma upon graduation? \\n             While our philosophy is based around mastery and not credentials, we do provide our Bootcamp and Flex graduates with diplomas upon graduation.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What’s the difference between the Intro to Web Development and Intro to Front-End with JavaScript course? \\n             Think about it this way, the Intro to Web Development course covers the breadth of Web Development including both front-end and back-end, while the Intro to Front-End with JavaScript course deals solely in front-end development in greater depth. If you want to get a good understanding of how teams web technologies work and gain a better way to communicate with developers, then take the Intro to Web Development Course. However, if you want to learn more front-end skills like learning how to style websites and gain a more practical skillset, then the Intro to Front-End with JavaScript course should be your pick. \\n\\n There is no right or wrong choice but they provide different outcomes based on what you are looking to gain out of the course. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Which should I take: the Intro course or the Bootcamp? \\n             Ask yourself: \"Do I want to work as a professional developer?\" \\n\\n If the answer is  'yes' , then there is no question that the full-time development bootcamp is the program you need. \\n\\n The goal of our bootcamp is to transform you into a professional full-stack developer. You’ll come to understand coding logic, and learn how to think like a dev by building software from the ground up using industry-relevant technologies. Our program will provide you with mentorship, data-driven curriculum and a top notch learning environment that will launch you into your first junior developer role. \\n\\n If the answer is  'not sure' , taking our part-time course might be the best option. \\n\\n Our Intro to Web Development and Front End Fundamentals with JavaScript courses are excellent for: \\n\\n \\n   People interested in learning how to code \\n   People interested in learning how to communicate with a development team \\n   People looking to gain career skills to help in a hybrid role \\n   People interested in learning if they enjoy development before taking our Bootcamp \\n \\n\\n You can read more on the subject in our blog post:  Full-time vs. Part-time: Which Program Is For Me? \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             I already have a technical background.

Students will become familiar with the fundamentals of web dev concepts and techniques like Javascript, HTML and CSS, HTTP, Ruby on Rails, and more. This program will prepare you to work as a Front-end Developer and in any general web developer position. \\n \\n           \\n       \\n     \\n   \\n\\n   \\n     \\n        \\n           \\n         \\n     \\n     \\n           Admissions \\n       \\n           \\n             \\n             What’s your admissions process? \\n             Our students put their trust in us, so we hold ourselves to the highest standards to ensure that everyone coming into our program is set up for success.   \\n\\n The application process takes 4 steps:   \\n\\n Apply online:   Complete our online application , where you'll introduce yourself and give us an overview of your background. This includes your education, coding experience, plus your super power (you know, the important details that will help us get to know you).   \\n\\n Interview:  \\nYou can book in for your interview during the application process, otherwise you will be emailed with a link to book it in later. We want to meet you, get to know you better and talk all about bootcamp. This is also your opportunity to ask us anything!  \\n\\n Logic and Technical Assessments:  After the group interview, successful candidates will be sent over some material to study so they can prepare for our logic and technical assessments. You do not need to have prior experience in coding or data science to perform well on these tests, and we will provide you with all the resources you need to successfully complete them! These are both multiple choice and done online on your own time within a 2-week period of your group interview. Once these assessments are complete, students can be accepted into the program.    \\n\\n Prep Modules:  The 70 hours you’ll spend on the Prep Modules will introduce the basic technologies you’ll use throughout bootcamp. You’re required to complete the Prep Modules in the weeks leading up to your first day on campus. Ask admissions for more information. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Do I need any specific experience to take a Lighthouse Labs Bootcamp? \\n             No formal education is required to being admitted to Lighthouse Labs! While having some coding knowledge or technical experience always helps, your background does not matter as much as a genuine interest in code, data science, or cyber security and a raw determination to succeed in this challenging environment. A passion for tech and a little bit of grit can be all that's needed to succeed! \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Tell me more about these prep modules. \\n             The prep work is there to help you do the groundwork and prepare for success before Day One of Bootcamp. Each student is required to complete a 70-hr prep module at least one week before starting Bootcamp. The program is really 14 weeks long, as we consider the prep modules to be two weeks of full-time work  on top of  the 12 weeks of bootcamp.  However, you can jump into the Prep Modules as soon as you are confirmed into the program, so we recommend that you use all the extra time to make sure you get through all the prep with plenty of time to spare. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What is the difference between Lighthouse Labs and other digital skills schools? \\n             There are many ways Lighthouse Labs is unique. Our niche is delivering digital skills training that's accelerated, personalized, and outcomes-oriented. Everything we do is geared towards finding the best ways to connect students with better careers.  \\n\\n \\n   We have a rigorous  admissions process , and will only admit potential students who we believe are able to thrive in an intensive learning environment. \\n   Our curriculums are built by industry professionals to teach industry relevant technologies, and are constantly iterated to stay on top of development trends.  We &lt;3 data-driven education . \\n   You'll spend 2 hours in lecture a day, and then spend the remainder of your 12+ hour day with hands on keyboard, practicing the skills and concepts you'll need to land a job as a dev or data analyst. \\n   We are strong believers in the power of mentorship. At Lighthouse, you'll be supported by a huge community of industry professionals. Our mentors are full-time developers or data analysts who are available in-person throughout the day and on weekends to support your progress through bootcamp. \\n   We also do regular testing, and collect daily feedback from our students and communities to constantly improve our student experience.  Our community  consists of over 500 alumni, mentors, and community partners that help our students stay on the pulse of innovation in the tech ecosphere. \\n   We have an experienced  Career Services  team that is entirely dedicated to connecting with employers and finding our alumni careers, which is how we've been able to achieve over an 93% employment rate for our job-seeking graduates. \\n \\n\\n To learn more about our graduate employment rates and how our career services sets us apart, check out our  Student Outcomes Report . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What are the admissions criteria? \\n             Standard Admissions Process: \\n - Complete interview (group or individual)\\n - Pass logic with a score 8/15 OR get a score of greater or equal to 9/18 on a Tech Test \\n\\n In addition to the Standard Admissions Process, the following provinces have the further requirements as outlined below: \\n\\n Ontario: \\n  - Minimum age 18+ years or proof of an Ontario Secondary School Diploma or equivalent\\n  - Ontario Superintendent approved qualifying test - Domestic Applicants pass the Logic Test with a score &gt;=8/15 OR get a score of &gt;=9/18 on a Tech Test \\n\\n Alberta: \\n Standard Admission: \\n  - Proof of Alberta high school graduation (verified by transcript) or equivalent or\\nSuccessful completion of the General Equivalency Diploma (G.E.D.)\\n Mature Admission:\\n  - Minimum age 18+ years and successful completion of Logic Test \\n\\n Quebec: \\n  - Minimum age 18+ years or proof of high school graduation or equivalent \\n\\n In British Columbia and all areas outside of Ontario, Alberta and Quebec: \\n  - Minimum age 19+ years or proof of high school graduation \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How far in advance should I apply? \\n             For our Bootcamps, we recommend you  apply  6-10 weeks before your desired start date as our cohorts start on a rolling basis. The more time you have to complete your Prep Modules and stretch goals, the better! For our intro part-time courses, we recommend you register and pay your deposit as early as possible to secure your spot - classes are often full a few weeks before the start date. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What can I do to prepare for Bootcamp? \\n             There is a prep work module you are required to complete before attending bootcamp, and we always recommend you go above and beyond the prep work to prepare yourself as much as possible! The more coding practice you have before attending the program, the happier you will be. \\n\\n Aside from practicing your tech skills, there are two things you can do which will set you up for success in the program. The first is to make sure you are comfortable with getting yourself into a productive, focused mindset. The ability to do this is a differentiating factor when it comes to success in the program. Students who are able to put themselves into a mindset that is productive and focused have an easier time adapting to the schedule and also are better at absorbing new material. Some people work best with headphones, some need quiet, some can just throw a mental switch. Find what works for you and get in the routine of doing it. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What do you look for in an applicant? \\n             At Lighthouse Labs, we want to make sure we're setting our students up for success. When choosing students to take on, we look for people who are seeking growth and who want to work towards it, who are able to do well in an intense learning environment, and who are passionate and curious about coding or data. \\n\\n Those are the only requirements: our students come from all kinds of backgrounds and walks of life.  Neuroscientists, accountants, teachers, and musicians have all passed through our programs.    \\n\\n You can learn more about our admissions process on our  admissions page . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             I'm on the waitlist! When will I find out if I’m in the course? \\n             If you are waitlisted for one of our programs, the admissions team will contact you ASAP when a new spot becomes available. If no spots open up, and the class is still full on the course start date, we will be in touch to either transfer you to our next available cohort or refund your deposit (whichever you prefer!). \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How often do you run cohorts and how do I apply? \\n             Our bootcamps run year round, most on a rolling basis. Our part-time courses run every 6-12 weeks.  \\n\\n Visit our website regularly to  check our upcoming start dates . \\n\\n Pro tip: you can see all upcoming start dates when  submitting your application . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Why is your Bootcamp only 12 weeks? \\n             Our goal is to get you job ready and employed as quickly as possible. By accelerating your learning into 12 weeks, you can start your new career ASAP. We strongly believe that your  first year after bootcamp  will be where you do the most learning - so while we could cram more coding knowledge into your brain, we don't want you to twiddle your thumbs when you could be tapping on keys, making $$ and gaining real experience as a developer or analyst. \\n\\n 12 weeks has proven to be the ideal balance to absorb the material, practice your skills and prepare for your job hunt, all while maintaining the pace, intensity and immersive nature of bootcamp. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Immigration requirements? \\n             Immigration requirements change regularly, so please visit the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) website at  www.cic.gc.ca  for the most up-to-date information. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What if I’m a strong coder but my English isn’t strong? \\n             Due to the content covered in our programs, we would require students to meet our language requirements before applying to enroll in our web courses. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Study Permit \\n             As the Web Development Flex Program is 30 weeks in length, all international students will need to  apply  for a study permit.  \\n\\n A students can work off campus (up to 20 hours) and full-time (40 hours per week) during scheduled academic breaks without a  Work Permit  as long as they meet all of these requirements: \\n\\n \\n They are a full-time student at a  designated learning institution (DLI) \\n They are enrolled in an  academic ,  vocational  or  professional training  program or their study program is at least 6 months long and leads to a degree, diploma or certificate \\n There Study Permit says you can work off campus \\n They have already started studying \\n They have a  Social Insurance Number (SIN) \\n \\n\\n If they have registered for a program that includes a co-op, it is suggested that they should be applying for a Co-op Work Permit at the time of filling out your Study Permit application. \\n\\n *DLI: Designated Learning Institution \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How far in advance should I apply for Work Study Bootcamp? \\n             Typically international students register at least six months prior to a start date. This gives them time to plan, save, apply for a visa, receive an approved visa and prepare for moving to a new country. Some countries have faster visa approval timelines and you can see estimated timelines for your country  here .  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What’s the difference between Lighthouse Labs and any other bootcamp? \\n             There are many ways Lighthouse Labs is unique.

While we are hoping that this policy may change in the future, if you are seeking a Post Graduate Work Permit, we recommend you research and consider a publicly funded college.\\nWe have many international students that study with us for various other reasons outside of receiving a PGWP. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n              What’s your admissions process for International students?  \\n             Our students put their trust in us, so we hold ourselves to the highest standards to ensure that everyone coming into our program is set up for success. \\n\\n The application process takes 4 steps: \\n\\n Apply online:   Complete our online application , where you'll introduce yourself and give us an overview of your background.

The more coding practice you have before attending the program, the happier you will be.   \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What are your student policies? \\n             Click here  to read the Lighthouse Labs Code of Conduct.

Planning for the hustle and bustle of pandemic era study-from-home routine, we recommend that students set aside at least 25 hours a week. This will make time for unplanned interruptions and the mental transitions between studying and your other responsibilities. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What is mentorship like during the Work Study Bootcamp? \\n             The core of your work will be completed between 9am and 2pm Monday to Thursday, this will include lectures, social learning time, instructor hours and opportunities to interact with your cohort socially. Mentors will also be available to you throughout the week, including weekends, to ensure you have the support needed to complete the course work. We recommend setting aside at least 25 hours each week (including those hours above) to work through the required material which allows student to balance their education with whatever else is going on in their lives. \\n \\n           \\n       \\n     \\n   \\n\\n   \\n     \\n        \\n           \\n         \\n     \\n     \\n           Career Services \\n       \\n           \\n             \\n             What are your graduate employment rates? \\n             97% of our job-seeking graduates have been hired after graduating, and 87% within 180 days of graduation!

You’re required to complete the Prep Modules in the weeks leading up to your first day of the program. \\n \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What financial options do you have? \\n             You can explore our financing options here: \\n https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/blog/financing-your-bootcamp-journey \\n\\n It is important to mention that you can also apply for  a scholarship  even if you receive financing through other means like grants and/or loans. Submit an  online application  to our program, and you'll receive an email to fill out the necessary information for our scholarship program. \\n\\n The fee for the bootcamp can be paid in two parts, both of which are due before the program begins. To reserve a spot in the program, a deposit is required. This step occurs once you go through the admissions process 6-10 weeks ahead of the start of the listed date of bootcamp, and pending approval into the program. Then, two weeks before the bootcamp begins, the remaining balance of the tuition is due.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Do you have any travel advice? \\n             The Public Health Agency of Canada is recommending that travellers avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada. To limit the spread of COVID-19, many countries have put in place travel or border restrictions and other measures such as movement restrictions and quarantines. Additionally, Canada has temporarily closed its borders to non-citizens because of the coronavirus pandemic. Please visit  Government of Canada - Travel Advice and Advisories  for more information.  \\n\\n If you are still considering travelling or are already outside of Canada: \\n\\n \\n Check your destination’s Safety and security, Entry/exit requirements and Health sections. \\n Get the Government of Canada’s latest updates on COVID-19. \\n Check the Pandemic COVID-19 travel health notice. \\n Find out what commercial options are still available to return to Canada. Consider returning to Canada earlier than planned if these options are becoming more limited. \\n Ensure that you have sufficient finances and necessities, including medication, in case your travels are disrupted. \\n Check with your travel insurance provider to know more about their policies related to COVID-19. Find out if you are covered for medical treatment if you become infected with COVID-19 as well as for extended stays outside of Canada. \\n \\n\\n Upon return to Canada: \\n\\n \\n Self-isolate for 14 days after your return from travel outside of Canada. Some provinces and territories may have specific recommendations for certain groups such as health care workers. \\n Monitor your health for fever, cough or difficulty breathing. \\n Wash your hands often for 20 seconds and cover your mouth and nose with your arm when coughing or sneezing. \\n \\n\\n If you develop a fever, cough or difficulty breathing within 14 days: \\n\\n \\n Continue to isolate yourself from others \\n Immediately call a health care professional or public health authority and:\\n\\n \\n describe your symptoms and travel history \\n follow their instructions carefully \\n \\n \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Are events cancelled? \\n             All events, including Demo Days and Info Sessions, now take place online. Follow our  Events page  for the latest information. \\n \\n           \\n       \\n     \\n   \\n\\n   \\n     \\n        \\n           \\n         \\n     \\n     \\n           Programs \\n       \\n           \\n             \\n             What are your graduate employment rates? \\n             97% of our job-seeking graduates have been hired after graduating, and 87% within 180 days of graduation! You can view the complete breakdown of our employment statistics in our  Student Outcomes Report . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Can I enroll in the Web Development Flex Program as an international student? \\n             To enroll in the Web Flex Development Program, prospective students who aren’t Canadian residents would need to obtain a study permit. If they’re prepared to obtain one they’re more than welcome to apply! However, we do require a short essay of intent and proof of proficiency in English. Students who are not eligible to work in Canada full-time for minimum one year after graduation will also not be eligible for Career Services. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What is the difference between Web Development Bootcamp and the Web Development Flex Program? \\n             Both bootcamp and flex cover the same material. Students of both will become familiar with the fundamentals of web dev concepts and techniques like Javascript, HTML and CSS, HTTP, Ruby on Rails, and more. The key difference between these programs is the structure. Web Flex is a less concentrated program over a longer stretch of time, whereas Web Bootcamp is more concentrated. These two programs both exist to accommodate a wider variety of student lifestyles and priorities, so that students can strike a balance that works for them without compromising on quality.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Should I take the Web Bootcamp or the Web Flex Program? \\n             Both these programs exist so as to accommodate students’ lifestyles and priorities. If you’re currently working in a position that you want to continue while training, we recommend you enroll in the less concentrated Web Flex. This is also a great option if you’re a parent or caregiver with substantial childcare duties.  \\n\\n If you want to get started with a new career as a web developer as soon as possible, and don’t want to wait for six months, Web Bootcamp is the better option for you. This is also a good fit if you have priorities to attend to half a year down the road.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How are Flex Scholarship recipients selected? \\n             Our scholarship committee reads through the applications thoroughly in order to decide whether a student is eligible. Scholarships are awarded on a first come, first served basis so we recommend applying early, as funding is limited. Your scholarship essay will only be considered once you have submitted your essay and been accepted into the program. No deposit is required before you know your scholarship eligibility. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What is your refund policy? \\n             Lighthouse Labs is a privately registered educational institution in four Canadian provinces. To comply with the unique regulations of each province, we have four distinct refund policies:\\n Bootcamp Refund Policy - Alberta \\n Bootcamp Refund Policy - British Columbia \\n Bootcamp Refund Policy - Ontario \\n Bootcamp Refund Policy - Quebec \\n Part-time Programs Refund Policy \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How do coding bootcamps compare to traditional education, like a Computer Science degree? \\n             The bootcamp educational model is built very differently from the ones you experienced in high school and/or university. Lighthouse Labs practices a flipped, immersive model of education that puts the emphasis on the development of practical skills through building real-world applications using an incremental and cumulative collection of tools and best practices.   \\n\\n Lectures take up a maximum of two and a half hours in any given day, with another eight to ten hours being spent each day working in a lab setting. You can expect to introduce yourself to new concepts through readings and exercises, getting your knowledge bolstered and backfilled with lectures throughout the week. You can learn more about the bootcamp experience our blog post:  So You Want To Take A Bootcamp    \\n\\n It is our core belief that 80% of the learning should be done on the job and we’ve tailored every part of our program around it. Our curriculum is constantly interrupted by a community of passionate developers based off feedback from employers, students, alumni and industry trends. We won’t teach you everything about software development (that takes years of practice), but we will give you the foundation so you can continue learning in your new career as a developer as quickly as possible.   \\n\\n For more details, read about our  Education Philosophies  or explore our  Student Outcomes Report . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What type of job can I expect to get after graduating from the Web Development Flex Program? \\n             Web Flex will prepare you to work in a role as a professional developer. Some roles you might occupy include web developer, front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Will I get a job after the Web Development Flex program even if I have no prior background in coding or computer science? \\n             Yes! You don’t need any experience in coding or computer science to succeed in Web Flex and be connected to employment afterwards. This program will provide you with everything you need to work as a professional web developer.   \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Is the Web Flex Program easier than the Web Bootcamp? \\n             These programs are fundamentally equivalent in terms of content. For some, the more intensive schedule of Web Bootcamp may be more challenging, but for others, the longer stretch of Web Flex might be more challenging.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Can I use provincial student aid towards the Web Flex Development Program? \\n             The Web Flex Development Program qualifies for StudentAid BC (SABC). Provincial aid eligibility for other provinces will soon be announced; please stay tuned.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Are Web Flex students eligible for Career Services?  \\n             Yes, Web Flex students also benefit from guidance with the Career Services dream team as part of their program. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What’s the difference between Web Development Flex Program and the Intro to Web Development part-time course? \\n             The part-time course is an introductory overview of the components that comprise a full-stack web application. This course is great for individuals who are interested in increasing their knowledge about web development, or who work in roles adjacent to tech. The Web Flex program is a more in-depth look at web development, and will provide students with everything they need to kick-start a career as a professional developer.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Can I opt out of Career Services as a Web Flex student?  \\n             For those that are returning to their same employer after graduation, interested in working as a freelancer or entrepreneur, or ineligible to work, we offer a Non-Job Seekers option that excludes Career Services. Students must indicate that they want the program that excludes Career Services upon enrolling.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Will I get a job after the Data Science program even if I have no prior background? \\n             Yes! You don’t need any experience in data science to succeed and be connected to employment afterward. This program will provide you with everything you need to work as a professional data scientist at an entry-level or junior position. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Do I get a diploma upon graduation? \\n             While our philosophy is based around mastery and not credentials, we do provide our Bootcamp and Flex graduates with diplomas upon graduation.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What is the difference between Data Analytics and Data Science? \\n             Data analysts use past data to draw meaningful insights, identify trends, develop charts, solve \\nproblems and help businesses make more strategic decisions. They analyze well-defined sets \\nof data using different tools to answer tangible business questions. \\n\\n Data Scientists estimate and predict the unknown by asking questions, writing algorithms, and \\nbuilding predictive models to help businesses make more strategic decisions. Data scientists \\nare typically tasked with designing data modeling processes, as well as creating algorithms and \\npredictive models to extract the information needed by an organization to solve complex \\nproblems. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Do I need to have experience in programming languages to take this Bootcamp? \\n             No previous data science, data analysis, or programming experience is required to attend Lighthouse Labs. As with our Web Development Bootcamp, every student needs some serious grit to excel (ha!) here, as well as a commitment to teamwork and a genuine interest in building their future career in business.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How do Bootcamps compare to traditional education, like a Data Analytics / Data Science degree? \\n             The Bootcamp educational model is built very differently from the way you learned in high school and/or university. Lighthouse Labs, practices a flipped, immersive model of education that puts the emphasis on the development of practical skills through building real-world applications using an incremental and cumulative collection of tools and best practices. \\n\\n Lectures take up a maximum of two and a half hours on any given day, with another eight to ten hours being spent each day working in a lab setting. You can expect to introduce yourself to new concepts through readings and exercises, getting your knowledge bolstered and backfilled with lectures throughout the week. \\n\\n It is our core belief that 70% of the learning should be done on the job and we’ve tailored every part of our program around it. Our curriculum is constantly iterated and updated by a community of passionate data science mentors based on feedback from employers, students, alumni, and industry trends. We won’t teach you everything about Data Science (that takes years of practice), but we will give you the foundation so you can continue learning in your new career as a Data Scientist as quickly as possible. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Why is there a Prep Course before the start of the Bootcamp? \\n             The first step to becoming a data scientist is laying your basic foundation with our Prep Course. The 70 hours you’ll spend on completing preparatory work will introduce the basic technologies you’ll use to get you ready and set to learn in the classroom on Day 1.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What type of job can I expect to get after graduating from the Data Science Bootcamp? \\n             The relevance of data science skills to a career goes beyond traditional roles like data analysts and data scientists. Because of the increased digitization of practically every industry, and the explosion of available data, being well-versed in data can be a lucrative skill for nearly everyone. \\n\\n Depending on the performance of our graduates during Bootcamp and their previous related experiences and education, our successful grads will be equipped for any of the following roles at a junior level: \\n\\n \\n Data Scientist \\n Data Analyst \\n Data Systems Developers \\n Machine Learning Engineers \\n Data Ops / Engineers \\n \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Do I need any specific experience to take a Lighthouse Labs Bootcamp? \\n             No formal education is required to being admitted to Lighthouse Labs! While having some coding knowledge or technical experience always helps, your background does not matter as much as a genuine interest in code, data science, or cyber security and a raw determination to succeed in this challenging environment. A passion for tech and a little bit of grit can be all that's needed to succeed! \\n \\n           \\n       \\n     \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n   \\n     Can't find your answers?

However, they often face obstacles during a traditional hiring process that limits the ability to gain real-world work experience. Partnering with Lighthouse Labs to combine the already impressive cognitive skills of people with autism with hands-on learning reflecting a workplace environment, will enable us to further deliver on the promise of the autism advantage for business.” auticon Canada \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ABOUT US \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t OUR SERVICES \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t CONTACT US \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t PRIVACY POLICY \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t |  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t CODE OF CONDUCT \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Facebook-f Twitter Google-plus Linkedin   Sign up to receive future email communications from Lighthouse Labs.

However, they often face obstacles during a traditional hiring process that limits the ability to gain real-world work experience. Partnering with Lighthouse Labs to combine the already impressive cognitive skills of people with autism with hands-on learning reflecting a workplace environment, will enable us to further deliver on the promise of the autism advantage for business.” auticon Canada \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ABOUT US \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t OUR SERVICES \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t CONTACT US \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t PRIVACY POLICY \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t |  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t CODE OF CONDUCT \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Facebook-f Twitter Google-plus Linkedin   Sign up to receive future email communications from Lighthouse Labs.

\\n             Lighthouse Labs will take you from coding hobbyist to professional developer, and be the launchpad for your career.   \\n\\n Based out of Canada’s most dynamic tech hubs, you’ll be immersed into full-stack web through hands-on experience. With the support of a brilliant team of instructors and mentors who view coding as the ultimate craft, you’ll join the ranks of over 500 developers in the  Lighthouse Labs community .   \\n\\n Our industry driven curriculum and rigorous education standards have created the ultimate result for our graduates: over  95% employment rate . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How do coding bootcamps compare to traditional education, like a Computer Science degree? \\n             The bootcamp educational model is built very differently from the ones you experienced in high school and/or university. Lighthouse Labs practices a flipped, immersive model of education that puts the emphasis on the development of practical skills through building real-world applications using an incremental and cumulative collection of tools and best practices.   \\n\\n Lectures take up a maximum of two and a half hours in any given day, with another eight to ten hours being spent each day working in a lab setting. You can expect to introduce yourself to new concepts through readings and exercises, getting your knowledge bolstered and backfilled with lectures throughout the week. You can learn more about the bootcamp experience our blog post:  So You Want To Take A Bootcamp    \\n\\n It is our core belief that 80% of the learning should be done on the job and we’ve tailored every part of our program around it. Our curriculum is constantly interrupted by a community of passionate developers based off feedback from employers, students, alumni and industry trends. We won’t teach you everything about software development (that takes years of practice), but we will give you the foundation so you can continue learning in your new career as a developer as quickly as possible.   \\n\\n For more details, read about our  Education Philosophies  or explore our  Student Outcomes Report . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Is Lighthouse Labs an accredited institution? \\n             Lighthouse Labs is accredited by British Columbia  PTIB #03874 , Alberta  PCC #304840  and Ontario  PCC #272306 , and certified by Canada department of  ESDC #7009  and with Revenue QC #20-09-4126,  EQA (Education Quality Assurance) , and with  Educanada . You're here to learn, let us worry about the paperwork. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Do I get a diploma upon graduation? \\n             While our philosophy is based around mastery and not credentials, we do provide our Bootcamp and Flex graduates with diplomas upon graduation.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What’s the difference between the Intro to Web Development and Intro to Front-End with JavaScript course? \\n             Think about it this way, the Intro to Web Development course covers the breadth of Web Development including both front-end and back-end, while the Intro to Front-End with JavaScript course deals solely in front-end development in greater depth. If you want to get a good understanding of how teams web technologies work and gain a better way to communicate with developers, then take the Intro to Web Development Course. However, if you want to learn more front-end skills like learning how to style websites and gain a more practical skillset, then the Intro to Front-End with JavaScript course should be your pick. \\n\\n There is no right or wrong choice but they provide different outcomes based on what you are looking to gain out of the course. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Which should I take: the Intro course or the Bootcamp? \\n             Ask yourself: \"Do I want to work as a professional developer?\" \\n\\n If the answer is  'yes' , then there is no question that the full-time development bootcamp is the program you need. \\n\\n The goal of our bootcamp is to transform you into a professional full-stack developer. You’ll come to understand coding logic, and learn how to think like a dev by building software from the ground up using industry-relevant technologies. Our program will provide you with mentorship, data-driven curriculum and a top notch learning environment that will launch you into your first junior developer role. \\n\\n If the answer is  'not sure' , taking our part-time course might be the best option. \\n\\n Our Intro to Web Development and Front End Fundamentals with JavaScript courses are excellent for: \\n\\n \\n   People interested in learning how to code \\n   People interested in learning how to communicate with a development team \\n   People looking to gain career skills to help in a hybrid role \\n   People interested in learning if they enjoy development before taking our Bootcamp \\n \\n\\n You can read more on the subject in our blog post:  Full-time vs. Part-time: Which Program Is For Me? \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             I already have a technical background. Will Lighthouse Labs be challenging enough for me? \\n             Absolutely! Many of our students come from technical backgrounds, including people with Computer Science and Engineering degrees, and even people who currently work as developers. Our curriculum is designed with stretch goals to challenge students of all levels. You will also be surrounded by lots of seasoned developers who will be pushing you out of your comfort zone, so trust us that there will plenty of challenge – our unofficial motto is “get comfortable being uncomfortable”.   \\n\\n While the program is geared towards people of all coding levels, it takes dedication, grit and perseverance to handle a program of this pace and intensity. Our goal is to push everyone to their maximum learning experience in an 10 week period, and advanced students who have come to Lighthouse Labs have grown exponentially in the small, intense time frame.   \\n\\n You can read more about some of our students who came to Lighthouse with strong technical backgrounds, like  Andre Soesilo  who came to Lighthouse with 3 years experience as a Software Developer + a degree in Computer Engineering, or  Katie Peterson  a former Engineer turned iOS Developer. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Can I come to Lighthouse Labs as an International student? \\n             Yes, you can come to Lighthouse Labs as an international student! There is no additional tuition cost or restrictions for people applying from outside of Canada. We have had many students come to Canada for our Bootcamp on a visitors visa, however you are entirely responsible for making any legal arrangements for staying in the country.   \\n\\n Lighthouse Labs is not able to assist in securing working permits, and your eligibility to work in Canada will entirely depend on you securing the proper documents. If you are able to obtain a working permit, you'll be able to take full advantage of our  Career Services  opportunities!   \\n\\n For more information on coming to Lighthouse Labs as an international student, check out the  Newcomer's Neighbourhood Guide . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Do you offer corporate training? \\n             Yes! Many organizations have sent their employees to us to upgrade their technical skills. \\n\\n Our Intro to  Web  Development courses are fantastic for people looking to gain a technical knowledge of development that can help when communicating with a dev team, managing development projects, understanding technical limitations, or transitioning into a hybrid development role. \\n\\n Our  Web  Development Bootcamps can train someone with zero coding experience, into an agile developer in 12 weeks. This is a great option if you love your company but are looking for a career change, if you are currently a developer but need to learn new technologies, or if you're a founder looking to have more control over your the development of your product. \\n\\n We can also build custom curriculum for your organization.

Our goal is to push everyone to their maximum learning experience in a 30 week period, and advanced students who have come to Lighthouse Labs have grown exponentially in the intense time frame. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What is the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Flex Work Study Bootcamp ?  \\n             Our Web Developer Work Study Bootcamp is designed to work with international students busy schedules of school, part-time work and living in a new city - all over 30 weeks. Students will become familiar with the fundamentals of web dev concepts and techniques like Javascript, HTML and CSS, HTTP, Ruby on Rails, and more. This program will prepare you to work as a Front-end Developer and in any general web developer position. \\n \\n           \\n       \\n     \\n   \\n\\n   \\n     \\n        \\n           \\n         \\n     \\n     \\n           Admissions \\n       \\n           \\n             \\n             What’s your admissions process? \\n             Our students put their trust in us, so we hold ourselves to the highest standards to ensure that everyone coming into our program is set up for success.   \\n\\n The application process takes 4 steps:   \\n\\n Apply online:   Complete our online application , where you'll introduce yourself and give us an overview of your background. This includes your education, coding experience, plus your super power (you know, the important details that will help us get to know you).   \\n\\n Interview:  \\nYou can book in for your interview during the application process, otherwise you will be emailed with a link to book it in later. We want to meet you, get to know you better and talk all about bootcamp. This is also your opportunity to ask us anything!  \\n\\n Logic and Technical Assessments:  After the group interview, successful candidates will be sent over some material to study so they can prepare for our logic and technical assessments. You do not need to have prior experience in coding or data science to perform well on these tests, and we will provide you with all the resources you need to successfully complete them! These are both multiple choice and done online on your own time within a 2-week period of your group interview. Once these assessments are complete, students can be accepted into the program.    \\n\\n Prep Modules:  The 70 hours you’ll spend on the Prep Modules will introduce the basic technologies you’ll use throughout bootcamp. You’re required to complete the Prep Modules in the weeks leading up to your first day on campus. Ask admissions for more information. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Do I need any specific experience to take a Lighthouse Labs Bootcamp? \\n             No formal education is required to being admitted to Lighthouse Labs! While having some coding knowledge or technical experience always helps, your background does not matter as much as a genuine interest in code, data science, or cyber security and a raw determination to succeed in this challenging environment. A passion for tech and a little bit of grit can be all that's needed to succeed! \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Tell me more about these prep modules. \\n             The prep work is there to help you do the groundwork and prepare for success before Day One of Bootcamp. Each student is required to complete a 70-hr prep module at least one week before starting Bootcamp. The program is really 14 weeks long, as we consider the prep modules to be two weeks of full-time work  on top of  the 12 weeks of bootcamp.  However, you can jump into the Prep Modules as soon as you are confirmed into the program, so we recommend that you use all the extra time to make sure you get through all the prep with plenty of time to spare. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What is the difference between Lighthouse Labs and other digital skills schools? \\n             There are many ways Lighthouse Labs is unique. Our niche is delivering digital skills training that's accelerated, personalized, and outcomes-oriented. Everything we do is geared towards finding the best ways to connect students with better careers.  \\n\\n \\n   We have a rigorous  admissions process , and will only admit potential students who we believe are able to thrive in an intensive learning environment. \\n   Our curriculums are built by industry professionals to teach industry relevant technologies, and are constantly iterated to stay on top of development trends.  We <3 data-driven education . \\n   You'll spend 2 hours in lecture a day, and then spend the remainder of your 12+ hour day with hands on keyboard, practicing the skills and concepts you'll need to land a job as a dev or data analyst. \\n   We are strong believers in the power of mentorship. At Lighthouse, you'll be supported by a huge community of industry professionals. Our mentors are full-time developers or data analysts who are available in-person throughout the day and on weekends to support your progress through bootcamp. \\n   We also do regular testing, and collect daily feedback from our students and communities to constantly improve our student experience.  Our community  consists of over 500 alumni, mentors, and community partners that help our students stay on the pulse of innovation in the tech ecosphere. \\n   We have an experienced  Career Services  team that is entirely dedicated to connecting with employers and finding our alumni careers, which is how we've been able to achieve over an 93% employment rate for our job-seeking graduates. \\n \\n\\n To learn more about our graduate employment rates and how our career services sets us apart, check out our  Student Outcomes Report . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What are the admissions criteria? \\n             Standard Admissions Process: \\n - Complete interview (group or individual)\\n - Pass logic with a score 8/15 OR get a score of greater or equal to 9/18 on a Tech Test \\n\\n In addition to the Standard Admissions Process, the following provinces have the further requirements as outlined below: \\n\\n Ontario: \\n  - Minimum age 18+ years or proof of an Ontario Secondary School Diploma or equivalent\\n  - Ontario Superintendent approved qualifying test - Domestic Applicants pass the Logic Test with a score >=8/15 OR get a score of >=9/18 on a Tech Test \\n\\n Alberta: \\n Standard Admission: \\n  - Proof of Alberta high school graduation (verified by transcript) or equivalent or\\nSuccessful completion of the General Equivalency Diploma (G.E.D.)\\n Mature Admission:\\n  - Minimum age 18+ years and successful completion of Logic Test \\n\\n Quebec: \\n  - Minimum age 18+ years or proof of high school graduation or equivalent \\n\\n In British Columbia and all areas outside of Ontario, Alberta and Quebec: \\n  - Minimum age 19+ years or proof of high school graduation \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How far in advance should I apply? \\n             For our Bootcamps, we recommend you  apply  6-10 weeks before your desired start date as our cohorts start on a rolling basis. The more time you have to complete your Prep Modules and stretch goals, the better! For our intro part-time courses, we recommend you register and pay your deposit as early as possible to secure your spot - classes are often full a few weeks before the start date. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What can I do to prepare for Bootcamp? \\n             There is a prep work module you are required to complete before attending bootcamp, and we always recommend you go above and beyond the prep work to prepare yourself as much as possible! The more coding practice you have before attending the program, the happier you will be. \\n\\n Aside from practicing your tech skills, there are two things you can do which will set you up for success in the program. The first is to make sure you are comfortable with getting yourself into a productive, focused mindset. The ability to do this is a differentiating factor when it comes to success in the program. Students who are able to put themselves into a mindset that is productive and focused have an easier time adapting to the schedule and also are better at absorbing new material. Some people work best with headphones, some need quiet, some can just throw a mental switch. Find what works for you and get in the routine of doing it. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What do you look for in an applicant? \\n             At Lighthouse Labs, we want to make sure we're setting our students up for success. When choosing students to take on, we look for people who are seeking growth and who want to work towards it, who are able to do well in an intense learning environment, and who are passionate and curious about coding or data. \\n\\n Those are the only requirements: our students come from all kinds of backgrounds and walks of life.  Neuroscientists, accountants, teachers, and musicians have all passed through our programs.    \\n\\n You can learn more about our admissions process on our  admissions page . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             I'm on the waitlist! When will I find out if I’m in the course? \\n             If you are waitlisted for one of our programs, the admissions team will contact you ASAP when a new spot becomes available. If no spots open up, and the class is still full on the course start date, we will be in touch to either transfer you to our next available cohort or refund your deposit (whichever you prefer!). \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How often do you run cohorts and how do I apply? \\n             Our bootcamps run year round, most on a rolling basis. Our part-time courses run every 6-12 weeks.  \\n\\n Visit our website regularly to  check our upcoming start dates . \\n\\n Pro tip: you can see all upcoming start dates when  submitting your application . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Why is your Bootcamp only 12 weeks? \\n             Our goal is to get you job ready and employed as quickly as possible. By accelerating your learning into 12 weeks, you can start your new career ASAP. We strongly believe that your  first year after bootcamp  will be where you do the most learning - so while we could cram more coding knowledge into your brain, we don't want you to twiddle your thumbs when you could be tapping on keys, making $$ and gaining real experience as a developer or analyst. \\n\\n 12 weeks has proven to be the ideal balance to absorb the material, practice your skills and prepare for your job hunt, all while maintaining the pace, intensity and immersive nature of bootcamp. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Immigration requirements? \\n             Immigration requirements change regularly, so please visit the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) website at  www.cic.gc.ca  for the most up-to-date information. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What if I’m a strong coder but my English isn’t strong? \\n             Due to the content covered in our programs, we would require students to meet our language requirements before applying to enroll in our web courses. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Study Permit \\n             As the Web Development Flex Program is 30 weeks in length, all international students will need to  apply  for a study permit.  \\n\\n A students can work off campus (up to 20 hours) and full-time (40 hours per week) during scheduled academic breaks without a  Work Permit  as long as they meet all of these requirements: \\n\\n \\n They are a full-time student at a  designated learning institution (DLI) \\n They are enrolled in an  academic ,  vocational  or  professional training  program or their study program is at least 6 months long and leads to a degree, diploma or certificate \\n There Study Permit says you can work off campus \\n They have already started studying \\n They have a  Social Insurance Number (SIN) \\n \\n\\n If they have registered for a program that includes a co-op, it is suggested that they should be applying for a Co-op Work Permit at the time of filling out your Study Permit application. \\n\\n *DLI: Designated Learning Institution \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How far in advance should I apply for Work Study Bootcamp? \\n             Typically international students register at least six months prior to a start date. This gives them time to plan, save, apply for a visa, receive an approved visa and prepare for moving to a new country. Some countries have faster visa approval timelines and you can see estimated timelines for your country  here .  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What’s the difference between Lighthouse Labs and any other bootcamp? \\n             There are many ways Lighthouse Labs is unique.

While we are hoping that this policy may change in the future, if you are seeking a Post Graduate Work Permit, we recommend you research and consider a publicly funded college.\\nWe have many international students that study with us for various other reasons outside of receiving a PGWP. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n              What’s your admissions process for International students?  \\n             Our students put their trust in us, so we hold ourselves to the highest standards to ensure that everyone coming into our program is set up for success. \\n\\n The application process takes 4 steps: \\n\\n Apply online:   Complete our online application , where you'll introduce yourself and give us an overview of your background. This includes your education, coding experience, plus your superpower (you know, the important details that will help us get to know you). You will also be asked to submit proof of your language proficiency and a short essay to get to know you better. \\n\\n Interview:  Our admissions team will get in touch after reviewing your application, and will invite you for a video interview. At that time, you can chat with our team, ask whatever questions you have about the program, and decide if Lighthouse Labs is the right fit for you. We also encourage you to check out our demo days held monthly so you can see the current cohort in action! This is also your opportunity to ask us anything. \\n\\n Logic & Technical Assessment:  After the last stage, successful candidates are sent over study material that will prepare them for the assessments. Coding experience isn't necessary to perform well here. You'll complete them on your own time within 2 weeks. \\n\\n Enroll & Prep for bootcamp:  Once you're accepted into a cohort, you'll need to submit a deposit by credit card to reserve your spot.

With that in mind, we believe that training students is about providing the right skills so you jump into their new careers. Our program isn’t designed to teach everything you need to know to become an expert — that takes years of practice. It’s designed to teach you just enough to successfully start a profession and continue learning throughout your career.   \\n\\n Learn more about this in our  Education Philosophies  blog post. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What languages, frameworks and subjects do you cover in Web Development Flex Work Study Bootcamp? \\n             JavaScript, Express.js, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, Sqlite, Postgres, Node.JS, HTML, CSS, Git, Front-end, Back-end, Sinatra, jQuery, AJAX, Product Management, UX, UI, Websockets, OOP, RSpec, TDD, BDD, APIs, REST, MVC, ES2015, Responsive Web Apps, Heroku \\n \\n           \\n       \\n     \\n   \\n\\n   \\n     \\n        \\n           \\n         \\n     \\n     \\n           COVID-19 \\n       \\n           \\n             \\n             Will part-time and full-time courses be cancelled? \\n             All in-person programs and events are now available in an online live format. Lighthouse has been running hybrid and online education in different formats since its inception, and in releasing our online bootcamps and part-time courses in 'Online Live' format all our students can be assured they will receive the same level of support and engaging environment. This includes on-demand mentorship, live-streamed interactive lectures, and incorporation of various messaging tools to make sure you experience going through your program with a cohort full of motivated peers.  \\n\\n Furthermore, with employers starting to look for more specific abilities around working remotely, the online live courses have been built to better simulate the current work environment that graduates will be entering. You will have the same access to all of the aspects of our career services support and we will work closely to prepare you for the competitive job hunt.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How will the situation impact my application process? \\n             We will continue to process applications with staff working remotely and continue to respond to emails and live chat messages. For more information please contact  hello@lighthouselabs.ca  or our Admissions Coordinator.  \\n\\n In general, the admission process takes these 3 steps:  \\n\\n \\n Apply online: Complete our  online application , where you'll introduce yourself and give us an overview of your background. This includes your education, coding experience, plus your superpower (you know, the important details that will help us get to know you).  \\n Interview: Once we receive your application, we’ll look over your experience, education, and work background. Our team will get in touch (quickly!) and will invite you for an online tech interview.  \\n Prep Modules: The 70 hours you’ll spend on the Prep Modules will introduce the basic technologies you’ll use throughout bootcamp. You’re required to complete the Prep Modules in the weeks leading up to your first day of the program. \\n \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What financial options do you have? \\n             You can explore our financing options here: \\n https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/blog/financing-your-bootcamp-journey \\n\\n It is important to mention that you can also apply for  a scholarship  even if you receive financing through other means like grants and/or loans. Submit an  online application  to our program, and you'll receive an email to fill out the necessary information for our scholarship program. \\n\\n The fee for the bootcamp can be paid in two parts, both of which are due before the program begins. To reserve a spot in the program, a deposit is required. This step occurs once you go through the admissions process 6-10 weeks ahead of the start of the listed date of bootcamp, and pending approval into the program. Then, two weeks before the bootcamp begins, the remaining balance of the tuition is due.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Do you have any travel advice? \\n             The Public Health Agency of Canada is recommending that travellers avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada. To limit the spread of COVID-19, many countries have put in place travel or border restrictions and other measures such as movement restrictions and quarantines. Additionally, Canada has temporarily closed its borders to non-citizens because of the coronavirus pandemic. Please visit  Government of Canada - Travel Advice and Advisories  for more information.  \\n\\n If you are still considering travelling or are already outside of Canada: \\n\\n \\n Check your destination’s Safety and security, Entry/exit requirements and Health sections. \\n Get the Government of Canada’s latest updates on COVID-19. \\n Check the Pandemic COVID-19 travel health notice. \\n Find out what commercial options are still available to return to Canada. Consider returning to Canada earlier than planned if these options are becoming more limited. \\n Ensure that you have sufficient finances and necessities, including medication, in case your travels are disrupted. \\n Check with your travel insurance provider to know more about their policies related to COVID-19. Find out if you are covered for medical treatment if you become infected with COVID-19 as well as for extended stays outside of Canada. \\n \\n\\n Upon return to Canada: \\n\\n \\n Self-isolate for 14 days after your return from travel outside of Canada. Some provinces and territories may have specific recommendations for certain groups such as health care workers. \\n Monitor your health for fever, cough or difficulty breathing. \\n Wash your hands often for 20 seconds and cover your mouth and nose with your arm when coughing or sneezing. \\n \\n\\n If you develop a fever, cough or difficulty breathing within 14 days: \\n\\n \\n Continue to isolate yourself from others \\n Immediately call a health care professional or public health authority and:\\n\\n \\n describe your symptoms and travel history \\n follow their instructions carefully \\n \\n \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Are events cancelled? \\n             All events, including Demo Days and Info Sessions, now take place online. Follow our  Events page  for the latest information. \\n \\n           \\n       \\n     \\n   \\n\\n   \\n     \\n        \\n           \\n         \\n     \\n     \\n           Programs \\n       \\n           \\n             \\n             What are your graduate employment rates? \\n             97% of our job-seeking graduates have been hired after graduating, and 87% within 180 days of graduation! You can view the complete breakdown of our employment statistics in our  Student Outcomes Report . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Can I enroll in the Web Development Flex Program as an international student? \\n             To enroll in the Web Flex Development Program, prospective students who aren’t Canadian residents would need to obtain a study permit. If they’re prepared to obtain one they’re more than welcome to apply! However, we do require a short essay of intent and proof of proficiency in English. Students who are not eligible to work in Canada full-time for minimum one year after graduation will also not be eligible for Career Services. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What is the difference between Web Development Bootcamp and the Web Development Flex Program? \\n             Both bootcamp and flex cover the same material. Students of both will become familiar with the fundamentals of web dev concepts and techniques like Javascript, HTML and CSS, HTTP, Ruby on Rails, and more. The key difference between these programs is the structure. Web Flex is a less concentrated program over a longer stretch of time, whereas Web Bootcamp is more concentrated. These two programs both exist to accommodate a wider variety of student lifestyles and priorities, so that students can strike a balance that works for them without compromising on quality.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Should I take the Web Bootcamp or the Web Flex Program? \\n             Both these programs exist so as to accommodate students’ lifestyles and priorities. If you’re currently working in a position that you want to continue while training, we recommend you enroll in the less concentrated Web Flex. This is also a great option if you’re a parent or caregiver with substantial childcare duties.  \\n\\n If you want to get started with a new career as a web developer as soon as possible, and don’t want to wait for six months, Web Bootcamp is the better option for you. This is also a good fit if you have priorities to attend to half a year down the road.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How are Flex Scholarship recipients selected? \\n             Our scholarship committee reads through the applications thoroughly in order to decide whether a student is eligible. Scholarships are awarded on a first come, first served basis so we recommend applying early, as funding is limited. Your scholarship essay will only be considered once you have submitted your essay and been accepted into the program. No deposit is required before you know your scholarship eligibility. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What is your refund policy? \\n             Lighthouse Labs is a privately registered educational institution in four Canadian provinces. To comply with the unique regulations of each province, we have four distinct refund policies:\\n Bootcamp Refund Policy - Alberta \\n Bootcamp Refund Policy - British Columbia \\n Bootcamp Refund Policy - Ontario \\n Bootcamp Refund Policy - Quebec \\n Part-time Programs Refund Policy \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How do coding bootcamps compare to traditional education, like a Computer Science degree? \\n             The bootcamp educational model is built very differently from the ones you experienced in high school and/or university. Lighthouse Labs practices a flipped, immersive model of education that puts the emphasis on the development of practical skills through building real-world applications using an incremental and cumulative collection of tools and best practices.   \\n\\n Lectures take up a maximum of two and a half hours in any given day, with another eight to ten hours being spent each day working in a lab setting. You can expect to introduce yourself to new concepts through readings and exercises, getting your knowledge bolstered and backfilled with lectures throughout the week. You can learn more about the bootcamp experience our blog post:  So You Want To Take A Bootcamp    \\n\\n It is our core belief that 80% of the learning should be done on the job and we’ve tailored every part of our program around it. Our curriculum is constantly interrupted by a community of passionate developers based off feedback from employers, students, alumni and industry trends. We won’t teach you everything about software development (that takes years of practice), but we will give you the foundation so you can continue learning in your new career as a developer as quickly as possible.   \\n\\n For more details, read about our  Education Philosophies  or explore our  Student Outcomes Report . \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What type of job can I expect to get after graduating from the Web Development Flex Program? \\n             Web Flex will prepare you to work in a role as a professional developer. Some roles you might occupy include web developer, front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Will I get a job after the Web Development Flex program even if I have no prior background in coding or computer science? \\n             Yes! You don’t need any experience in coding or computer science to succeed in Web Flex and be connected to employment afterwards. This program will provide you with everything you need to work as a professional web developer.   \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Is the Web Flex Program easier than the Web Bootcamp? \\n             These programs are fundamentally equivalent in terms of content. For some, the more intensive schedule of Web Bootcamp may be more challenging, but for others, the longer stretch of Web Flex might be more challenging.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Can I use provincial student aid towards the Web Flex Development Program? \\n             The Web Flex Development Program qualifies for StudentAid BC (SABC). Provincial aid eligibility for other provinces will soon be announced; please stay tuned.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Are Web Flex students eligible for Career Services?  \\n             Yes, Web Flex students also benefit from guidance with the Career Services dream team as part of their program. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What’s the difference between Web Development Flex Program and the Intro to Web Development part-time course? \\n             The part-time course is an introductory overview of the components that comprise a full-stack web application. This course is great for individuals who are interested in increasing their knowledge about web development, or who work in roles adjacent to tech. The Web Flex program is a more in-depth look at web development, and will provide students with everything they need to kick-start a career as a professional developer.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Can I opt out of Career Services as a Web Flex student?  \\n             For those that are returning to their same employer after graduation, interested in working as a freelancer or entrepreneur, or ineligible to work, we offer a Non-Job Seekers option that excludes Career Services. Students must indicate that they want the program that excludes Career Services upon enrolling.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Will I get a job after the Data Science program even if I have no prior background? \\n             Yes! You don’t need any experience in data science to succeed and be connected to employment afterward. This program will provide you with everything you need to work as a professional data scientist at an entry-level or junior position. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Do I get a diploma upon graduation? \\n             While our philosophy is based around mastery and not credentials, we do provide our Bootcamp and Flex graduates with diplomas upon graduation.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What is the difference between Data Analytics and Data Science? \\n             Data analysts use past data to draw meaningful insights, identify trends, develop charts, solve \\nproblems and help businesses make more strategic decisions. They analyze well-defined sets \\nof data using different tools to answer tangible business questions. \\n\\n Data Scientists estimate and predict the unknown by asking questions, writing algorithms, and \\nbuilding predictive models to help businesses make more strategic decisions. Data scientists \\nare typically tasked with designing data modeling processes, as well as creating algorithms and \\npredictive models to extract the information needed by an organization to solve complex \\nproblems. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Do I need to have experience in programming languages to take this Bootcamp? \\n             No previous data science, data analysis, or programming experience is required to attend Lighthouse Labs. As with our Web Development Bootcamp, every student needs some serious grit to excel (ha!) here, as well as a commitment to teamwork and a genuine interest in building their future career in business.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             How do Bootcamps compare to traditional education, like a Data Analytics / Data Science degree? \\n             The Bootcamp educational model is built very differently from the way you learned in high school and/or university. Lighthouse Labs, practices a flipped, immersive model of education that puts the emphasis on the development of practical skills through building real-world applications using an incremental and cumulative collection of tools and best practices. \\n\\n Lectures take up a maximum of two and a half hours on any given day, with another eight to ten hours being spent each day working in a lab setting. You can expect to introduce yourself to new concepts through readings and exercises, getting your knowledge bolstered and backfilled with lectures throughout the week. \\n\\n It is our core belief that 70% of the learning should be done on the job and we’ve tailored every part of our program around it. Our curriculum is constantly iterated and updated by a community of passionate data science mentors based on feedback from employers, students, alumni, and industry trends. We won’t teach you everything about Data Science (that takes years of practice), but we will give you the foundation so you can continue learning in your new career as a Data Scientist as quickly as possible. \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Why is there a Prep Course before the start of the Bootcamp? \\n             The first step to becoming a data scientist is laying your basic foundation with our Prep Course. The 70 hours you’ll spend on completing preparatory work will introduce the basic technologies you’ll use to get you ready and set to learn in the classroom on Day 1.  \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             What type of job can I expect to get after graduating from the Data Science Bootcamp? \\n             The relevance of data science skills to a career goes beyond traditional roles like data analysts and data scientists. Because of the increased digitization of practically every industry, and the explosion of available data, being well-versed in data can be a lucrative skill for nearly everyone. \\n\\n Depending on the performance of our graduates during Bootcamp and their previous related experiences and education, our successful grads will be equipped for any of the following roles at a junior level: \\n\\n \\n Data Scientist \\n Data Analyst \\n Data Systems Developers \\n Machine Learning Engineers \\n Data Ops / Engineers \\n \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n             Do I need any specific experience to take a Lighthouse Labs Bootcamp? \\n             No formal education is required to being admitted to Lighthouse Labs!

    "#### Text or content is a written source that conveys certain information in a certain structure, emotion and voice, and with different methodologies. Each piece of writing can be perceived as better with a specific subject in different aspects. Using different spelling techniques, sentence structures, or using different words makes the two texts on the same subject quite different from each other. It is useful to analyze content and text to see which sentence structure and form of call more useful to users and search engines. Python and Data Science are important terms of Holistic SEO. Thanks to data processing and Python, SEOs can analyze these kinds of information in a shorter time with less effort."

    "\n",
    "Create a custom search engine. At first you might be asked to enter a site to search. Enter any domain, then go to the control panel and remove it. Make sure you enable \"Search the entire web\" and image search. You will also need to get your search engine ID, which you can find on the control panel page.\n",
    "Enable the custom search API. You wil need to create a project for this first.\n",
    "create credentials for this project so you can get your key.\n",
    "enable billing for your project If you want to run more than 100 queries per day. The first 100 queries are free, then for each 1,000 queries you pay $5.\n",
